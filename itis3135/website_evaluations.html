      <h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/">Facebook Marketplace</a></h3>
      <p>Facebook Marketplace is a buy and sell application primarily marketed towards Facebook social media users. 
        It allows users to buy and sell items locally though various filters and categories. The website allows for 
        messaging, as well as reviews and ratings. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast: As I hover over certain components, I can easily navigate where I 
          am and where to find other features. I can clearly see the images and information
          of each product in an intuitive grid-like format. 
        </li>
        <li>Repetition: The product listings all follow the same format, indicating
          the product price, name, and location. 
        </li>
        <li>Alignment: All of the components are properly aligned. The lefthand navigation bar
          takes up just enough space to be noticed but does not overpower the central product page.
        </li>
        <li>Proximity: As you scroll, you can see products are intentionally sorted based on
          pricing and category. There is also enough space on the page to allow its components to breathe.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
      <p>The Yale School of Art Page serves to provide information about the instituion's 
        programs, faculty, and events. Unique to this website is the fact that all members of
        Yale's School of Art community can edit the website, fostering an experimental and collaborative
        design.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast: Some text is hard to read and impractical with its background. Additionally,
          there exists no coherent color scheme that makes sense. 
        </li>
        <li>Repetition: There exists no consistent formatting of text sections. Everything
          is a different size, margin, and color.
        </li>
        <li>Alignment: For whatever reason, the entirety of the page takes up
          a very weird portion of the overall page. One could describe it as maybe 55-60%.
        </li>
        <li>Proximity: There appear to be sections that can group different contents on the page together.
          However, there is not clear indication of why they are formatted the way they are. 
        </li>
