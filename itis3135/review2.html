    <ul>
      <li><strong>Repository Names: </strong>Everything named appropriately.</li>
      <li><strong>CSS File: </strong>The css has not been implemented and is incomplete. The user can only see the basic html texts.</li>
      <li><strong>Contrast: </strong> The css has not been implemented yet.</li>
      <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>There is a basic structure that is being formed but it is not clear as to what the end product may look like.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Alignment is still the default html due to lack of implemented css.</li>
      <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>More content and styling would be needed to evaluate the spacing properly. </li>
      <li><strong>Structure: </strong>Various files do not have a footer section implemented yet. Additionally, pages use head but should use header instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Header: </strong>The header section is wrapped in a head tag. However, the general design seems to be developing.</li>
      <li><strong>Main: </strong>Structured properly. Very intentional about showing different components through line spacing and naming.</li>
      <li><strong>Slogan: </strong>Site needs slogan and branding across pages. Maybe create a logo or tagline.</li>
      <li><strong>Footer: </strong>Not yet implemented into any of the pages.</li>
      <li><strong>Project Requirements: </strong> All neccessary pages are present, however there is not enough css or functionality to properly evaluate
        the website's overall design and purpose. For the future, I would definitely continue with the wireframe
        constructed on the project overview page. The styling would fit well with the intended purpose of the website.
