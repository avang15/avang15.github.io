    <h2>Contract</h2>
    <p>I, AIDEN T. VANG agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my FALL 
      2025, ITIS 3135, FRONT-END WEB APP DEVELOPMENT with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand 
      that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, 
      and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep 
      private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing 
      up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand 
      that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online 
      or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, 
      and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) 
      and never from my classmates. Signed: <em>Aiden T. Vang</em> , 8/22/2025</p>
