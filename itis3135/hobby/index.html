      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>Growing up, I lived with my grandfather and spent countless evenings with him in his room. As night fell, we would sit together in the soft glow of a small, boxy television, watching old-school Asian movies that he cherished. The faint hum of the TV, the flickering images, and the rhythmic sounds of dialogue and music created a world of their own. These films, often characterized by their poetic cinematography and deliberate pacing, left a profound impression on me. I remember being captivated not only by the stories but by the way light, color, and motion seemed to express emotions words could not.
        To me, these films became inseparable from my grandfather’s presence—the calm of his voice, his quiet laughter, and the warmth of those shared moments. Even now, when I revisit those films, I feel a deep sense of nostalgia, as though each scene carries a fragment of memory. They remind me of comfort, simplicity, and connection across generations. Over time, this experience grew into a genuine passion for cinema. I began to appreciate film not just as entertainment, but as an art form capable of preserving emotion, culture, and human experience. In many ways, my love for Asian cinematography is also a tribute to my grandfather, whose appreciation for these stories opened my eyes to the beauty of visual storytelling.

      <h3>Personal Connection</h3>
      <p>My personal connection to Asian cinema also dives deeper into my historical roots. I am Hmong, a southeast asian people that originate from Thailand. As a nomadic people, we have struggled to maintain the history of our people through political and economic struggles. Through cinema, we have been able to better document our journey across the world, educating others about our community! Read more about our history below:</p>

      <h2>What is Asian Cinematography?</h2>
      <p>Asian cinematography refers to the artistic stylization of films produced in Asia, 
        primarily in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. These films are known
        for stunning visuals, unique storytelling techniques, and a deep connection to human emotion.
        Asian filmmakers often emphasize atmosphere and mood through meticulous attention to color,
        lighting, and composition, using visual symbolism to communicate themes of identity, tradition, 
        and modernity. The cinematography frequently blends natural landscapes with urban settings, 
        reflecting the tension between the past and the present. Moreover, the pacing and framing 
        in Asian cinema often diverge from Western conventions, favoring long takes, minimalistic 
        dialogue, and contemplative silences that invite viewers to engage emotionally and intellectually.
        Through these techniques, Asian cinematography has influenced global filmmaking, offering new 
        perspectives on visual storytelling and redefining how emotion and narrative can be expressed 
        through the camera lens.
